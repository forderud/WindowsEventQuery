Sample projects for logging on Windows, including:
* `MyEventProvider`: Project for defining logging schemas.
* `MyEventLogger`: C++ project for logging through the provider.
* `MyEventLoggerCs`: C¤ project for logging through the provider.
* `WindowsEventQuery`: C++ project for querying Windows event logs.

## wevtutil tool
[wevtutil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/wevtutil) can be used to query the Windows Event log from the command-line.

Example queries:
* Last 5 critical or error events from the "System" log: `wevtutil qe "System" /q:"*[System/Level<=2]" /c:5 /rd:true /f:text`
* All events with warning or higher severity from "Application" log the last 24 hours: `wevtutil qe "Application" /q:"*[System[(Level>=1) and (Level<=3) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 86400000]]]" /f:text`

`/rd:true` means events are displayed from newest to oldest, and `/f:text` displays them as text instead of XML. 86400000 is the number of milliseconds in 24 hours.

Event severity level values: Critical (`System/Level=1`), Error (`System/Level=2`), Warning (`System/Level=3`), Information (`System/Level=4`).

NOTICE: `System/Level=0` information events have been observed in the "Application" log.

## Examples of logged events
